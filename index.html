      <h1>hi, i'm dana</h1>
      <p>
        I am a freelance <span class="hightlight">Software Engineer</span> based in Berlin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied <span class="hightlight">Computer Science</span> at <span class="hightlight">New York University</span> where I earned a Bachelor's in Arts and Sciences. I interned for <span class="hightlight">Spotify</span> as a Backend Engineer working in Java and <span class="hightlight">Adobe-Behance</span> as a Front-End Engineer working in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also worked at NYU's Music and Audio Research Lab (<span class="hightlight">MARL</span>) working on an open source library called <span class="hightlight">Librosa</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since graduating I have worked as a <span class="hightlight">Backend Engineer</span> at <span class="hightlight">Meetup</span> working in Java and occassionally Scala. I then moved to Berlin to work for <span class="hightlight">Ableton</span>. I first worked in <span class="hightlight">Developer Tools</span> working on CI/CD Pipelines and Cloud Computing. Afterwards, I worked on the <span class="hightlight">Live</span> team working on prototyping for MIDI clip generation and pushing software improvements for musicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about delivering <span class="hightlight">high quality and well-writen</span> software and creating an <span class="hightlight">empathetic and healthy</span> team environment.
      </p>

        Outside of tech, I enjoy learning about wine. Lately, I've been enjoying wines from Jura and Sicily. Feel free to write to me for some pairing suggestions for your next dinner!

        <h3>Project MVP</h3>
        <h4>Google X / December 2023</h4>
        <p>This project is still under NDA.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Live 12 Improvements</h3>
        <h4>Ableton / January 2023 - May 2023</h4>
        <p>Finish general improvements requested by musicians to Live 12. Some examples include: Soloing, muting, and adjusting the volume of multiple devices within a rack, inserting markers with shortcuts in Automation mode, and deleting tempo automation when deleting a track whose tempo is being followed. This required working with legacy code in C++ and working across teams to debug audio engine code.</p>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>MIDI Generation Prototyping</h3>
        <h4>Ableton / February 2022 - March 2022</h4>
        <p>Create a prototype for generating MIDI chords as part of developing the new MIDI Tools. I created a prototype which was a grid where the x-axis represented a possible chord within the scale and y-axis represented the note. The prototype also allowed you to select different scale. The project involved working with designers to create an interface and a deeper understanding into music theory.</p>

        <h3>Azure Migration</h3>
        <h4>Ableton / February 2021 - February 2022</h4>
        <p>Prior to this project, the team was running their microservices in an office room. We decided that this was no longer a stable and sustainable way to run the services since we were a remote team and the IT department had to assist us when we needed access to the servers. As a result, we migrated our microservices to Azure using Kubernetes and Terraform and monitored them using Grafana.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>CI/CD Pipeline Development</h3>
        <h4>Meetup / July 2018 - July 2019</h4>
        <p>Before this project, test coverages were non-existent and a developer had to manually quality check and deploy code by running commands to a remote server on their development computer. There were two tasks for the team. The first task was to build a pipeline with AWS ECS which was accessible via GitHub to automate code deployment upon merging. The second task was to employ test coverage within the codebase which was accessible within GitHub to maintain and improve code quality. For the project, the team worked with mob programming.</p>

        <h3>Librosa</h3>
        <h4>Librosa / January 2018 - May 2018</h4>
        <p>The goal of the project was to improve Librosa's commonly used functions using Numba. I worked primarily on the match events function. The biggest challenge was that there was Python functionality which Numba did not support, which had to be rewritten in NumPy. Numba-fying match events led to a 30-90x speed up in the codebase. I also used Jupyter Notebooks for benchmarking. You can also view the pull request <a class="link" href="https://github.com/librosa/librosa/pull/688">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Logout Page</h3>
        <h4>Adobe-Behance / May 2016 - August 2016</h4>
        <p>Created a new logout page to reflect the new design principles and theme of Behance. One of the goals was to give the users a brief yet clear understanding of what Behance offers as a product and inspire curiousity for potential users to get started. For the project, I worked with HTML and CSS and often communicated with designers to create a polished product. You can still view the page <a class="link" href="https://www.behance.net/loggedout">here</a>.</p>
