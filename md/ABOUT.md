# hi, i'm dana

I am a *Software Engineer* based in Berlin. I'm currently working 
as freelance software engineer working primarily on *Typescript*
and *Python* projects. I also have experience working with 
Javascript, Vue, Pinia, Express, C++, Terraform, Mongo, and Azure.

I studied *Computer Science* at *New York University* where I 
earned a Bachelor's in Arts and Sciences. I interned for *Spotify* 
as a Backend Engineer working in Java and *Adobe-Behance* as a 
Front-End Engineer working in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also 
worked at NYU's Music and Audio Research Lab (*MARL*) working on an 
open source library called *Librosa*.

Since graduating I have worked as a *Backend Engineer* at *Meetup* 
working in Java and occassionally Scala. I then moved to Berlin to 
work for *Ableton*. I first worked in *Developer Tools* working on 
CI/CD Pipelines and Cloud Computing. Afterwards, I worked on the 
*Live* team working on prototyping for MIDI clip generation and 
pushing software improvements for musicians. I also worked at *n8n* 
where I worked as a *Fullstack Engineer* on projects related to AI, 
Community Nodes, and Form improvements.

I'm passionate about delivering *high quality and well-written* 
software and creating an *empathetic and healthy* team environment.

Outside of tech, I enjoy music, food, wine, and nonalcoholics. If 
you're interested, you can check out my [Instagram](https://www.
